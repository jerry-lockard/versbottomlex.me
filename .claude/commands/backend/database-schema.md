Design a PostgreSQL database schema for the VersBottomLex.me platform that includes:

1. User accounts (performers and viewers)
2. Payment transactions
3. Stream information and history
4. User interactions (tips, messages, etc.)
5. Analytics data

For each table, include column definitions, data types, constraints, and relationships.
