# Comprehensive Platform Scaling Strategy

Develop a detailed, phased scaling plan for VersBottomLex.me to transition from a single-performer platform to a robust multi-performer streaming ecosystem capable of supporting thousands of concurrent streams and users.

## Current Architecture Analysis
- **Application Assessment**: Evaluate current architecture components
- **Performance Metrics**: Baseline performance measurements
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Determine current system constraints
- **Technical Debt**: Identify areas needing refactoring before scaling
- **Resource Utilization**: Current CPU, memory, network, storage usage

## Scaling Requirements
- **Target Scale**: {{concurrent_users}} concurrent users, {{concurrent_streams}} concurrent streams
- **Growth Projection**: {{monthly_growth_rate}}% monthly growth rate
- **Geographic Distribution**: {{geographic_regions}} primary regions
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain <200ms latency, 99.9% uptime
- **Budget Constraints**: {{budget_range}} for implementation
