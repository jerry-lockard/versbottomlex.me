# Flutter Biometric Authentication Implementation

Design and implement a secure, user-friendly biometric authentication system for the VersBottomLex.me Flutter application.

## Authentication Requirements
- **Primary Method**: Biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID)
- **Fallback Method**: PIN/password
- **Package**: flutter_local_auth or local_auth
- **Platforms**: Mobile (Android/iOS) with graceful web fallback
- **Integration**: Work alongside existing JWT authentication system

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Dependencies & Configuration
- [ ] Provide exact pubspec.yaml entries with version constraints
- [ ] Platform-specific configuration (AndroidManifest.xml, Info.plist)
- [ ] Required permissions explanation
- [ ] Gradle/Pod configuration if needed

### 2. Authentication Service
- [ ] Complete LocalAuthService class with proper dependency injection
- [ ] Device capability detection methods
- [ ] Biometric availability checking
- [ ] Authentication methods with proper error handling
- [ ] Secure credential storage integration
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Authentication state persistence

### 3. UI Components
- [ ] Biometric authentication prompt design
- [ ] Custom overlay for biometric scanning
- [ ] Fallback authentication UI flow
- [ ] Success/failure animations and feedback
- [ ] Accessibility considerations
- [ ] Dark/light mode support
- [ ] User feedback mechanisms

### 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for all biometric failures
- [ ] Graceful fallback when biometrics unavailable
- [ ] Too many attempts lockout mechanism
- [ ] Device change detection
- [ ] Handling OS-level biometric changes
- [ ] Security timeout implementation
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms

### 5. Integration Strategy
- [ ] How to integrate with existing AuthProvider
- [ ] App startup authentication flow
- [ ] Sensitive action re-authentication
- [ ] Settings for user configuration
- [ ] Analytics/reporting on authentication success rates
- [ ] Testing strategy across devices

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Proper encryption for stored credentials
- [ ] Anti-spoofing measures
- [ ] Secure communication with backend
- [ ] Privacy best practices
- [ ] Compliance with platform security guidelines

## Implementation Deliverables
- [ ] Complete, tested implementation code
- [ ] Usage documentation for other developers
- [ ] User documentation/tooltips
- [ ] Security recommendations

Ensure the implementation follows Flutter best practices with proper state management and clean architecture principles.
