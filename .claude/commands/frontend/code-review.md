### 2. UI/UX Implementation
- [ ] **Widget Structure**
  - Appropriate widget composition and hierarchy
  - Reusability of custom widgets
  - Consistent theming implementation

- [ ] **Responsive Design**
  - Layout adaptability across screen sizes
  - Appropriate use of MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder, etc.
  - Handling of orientation changes

- [ ] **Accessibility (a11y)**
  - Semantic labels and screen reader support
  - Color contrast considerations
  - Touch target sizing
  - Keyboard navigation support

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Rendering Efficiency**
  - Widget rebuilding optimization
  - Use of const constructors where appropriate
  - Custom paint and canvas efficiency

- [ ] **Memory Management**
  - Resource disposal (controllers, animations, etc.)
  - Image optimization and caching
  - ListView/GridView recycling with builders

- [ ] **Computational Efficiency**
  - Expensive operations moved off the UI thread
  - Appropriate use of compute() for isolates
  - Caching of expensive results

### 4. Data Handling
- [ ] **API Integration**
  - Proper error handling and retry logic
  - Loading states and user feedback
  - Effective data transformation

- [ ] **State Persistence**
  - Appropriate use of local storage
  - Serialization/deserialization efficiency
  - Offline capability implementation

- [ ] **Data Validation**
  - Input sanitization and validation
  - Edge case handling
  - Null safety implementation

### 5. Testing & Maintainability
- [ ] **Test Coverage**
  - Unit tests for business logic
  - Widget tests for UI components
  - Integration tests for flows

- [ ] **Code Documentation**
  - Class and method documentation
  - Complex logic explanation
  - Public API documentation

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Comprehensive error states
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Crash reporting readiness

## Security Considerations
- [ ] **Data Security**
  - Secure storage of sensitive information
  - No hardcoded credentials
  - Proper encryption implementation

- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - Protection against injection attacks
  - Proper sanitization of user inputs
  - Validation of data from external sources

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Lint Rules Compliance**: Evaluate against Flutter lint rules
- **Code Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity assessment
- **Maintainability Index**: Readability and maintainability score
- **Duplication**: Identification of copied code segments

## Review Format

### Summary
Provide a concise overview of the code quality, highlighting major strengths and areas for improvement.

### Critical Issues
List highest-priority items that require immediate attention, with specific code references and suggested fixes.

### Recommendations
Provide actionable, specific improvements organized by priority level:
1. **High Priority** - Must address before merging
2. **Medium Priority** - Should address soon
3. **Low Priority** - Consider for future refactoring

### Code Examples
Include specific code snippets showing both problematic patterns and suggested improvements.

### Best Practices
Reference relevant Flutter and Dart best practices that should be applied.

### Positive Highlights
Acknowledge well-implemented patterns and techniques that should be continued.

## Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Create JIRA/GitHub issues for critical findings
- [ ] Schedule pairing session for complex refactorings
- [ ] Update team coding guidelines based on recurring patterns
- [ ] Share positive patterns with the wider team

Provide this thorough code review with actionable feedback that maintains a constructive, educational tone while ensuring code quality standards are met.
